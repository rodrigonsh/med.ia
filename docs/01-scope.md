# Healthcare Startup Project Scope

## Overview
A Git-based healthcare data platform that:
- Stores patient medical records in version-controlled FHIR format
- Provides secure API access for healthcare institutions
- Enables AI-powered medical insights
- Maintains strict compliance with healthcare regulations

## Core Components

### 1. Data Infrastructure
- Git-Based Data Storage:
    - Patient-Centric Repositories: Use per-patient bare repositories with branch-per-institution (e.g., lab_corp/2023-10-cholesterol).
    - Data Layer: FHIR R4 Bundles stored as commit-linked JSON (enforced via JSON Schema). Large files (DICOM/PACS) will use IPFS with CID pointers in Git for content-addressable and versioned storage.
    - Commit Workflow: Cryptographic signing of commits to ensure data integrity and clear authorship.
- Distributed Ledger Syncing: Use Hyperledger Fabric for multi-institution consensus on critical writes (e.g., allergy updates), with Git hooks triggering blockchain validation pre-commit for audited fields.
- FHIR R4 data schemas and validation
- Data normalization pipelines

### 2. API & Integration Layer
- RESTful API: Endpoints: GET /patients/{id}/records?date=2023-01-01 (fetch historical data via Git tags/commits). POST /patients/{id}/records (creates a new Git commit with changes). Webhooks for real-time notifications (e.g., POST /webhooks/lab-results). Rate Limiting: Tier-based (e.g., free tier = 100 reqs/day, enterprise = unlimited). Bulk Operations: Async endpoints (e.g., POST /bulk/import returns a job_id). Support NDJSON/CSV for bulk FHIR data.
- RESTful FHIR API endpoints
- MCP server for AI/LLM integration
- Webhook notification system
- Bulk data import/export capabilities
- Developer portal with SDKs

### 3. AI & Analytics
- AI Co-Pilot Architecture:
    - Contextual Grounding: Use Vector Embeddings (FHIR → UMLS via ClinVar) and a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline.
    - PHI-Safe Inference: Implement Azure Trusted Launch for confidential LLM processing and Differential Privacy in training data.
- Medical question-answering system
- PHI anonymization layer
- Trend analysis and visualization
- Clinical decision support

### 4. Security & Access
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with Open Policy Agent (OPA) for fine-grained permissions.
- Patient consent management: Patients issue JWTs with FHIR resource scopes.
- Audit logging: Comprehensive tracking of all API operations for HIPAA/GDPR compliance.
- Emergency access protocols: Time-bound, blockchain-logged SAML assertions for ER overrides, with mandatory patient notification.

### 5. Billing & Operations
- Monetization Engine:
    - Value-Based Pricing: Per-Commit Fees ($0.0001/commit, free for patients), AI Credits ($0.01/LLM token, waived for nonprofit clinics), and Data Liquidity (15% rev share when labs purchase historical trends via API).
    - Government Contracts: CMS Blue Button 2.0-like bulk exports with Synthetic Data add-ons ($0.10/record).
- Usage-based pricing engine
- Enterprise contract management
- Revenue sharing systems
- Institutional onboarding

## Technical Requirements

### Data
- FHIR R4 compliant JSON
- Git LFS for large files
- Minimum 10-year data retention
- Real-time sync capabilities
- Compliance & Infrastructure: Hosting: Use HIPAA-compliant clouds (AWS GovCloud, Azure Healthcare APIs). Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Backups & DR: Geo-redundant Git mirrors (e.g., GitHub Enterprise Server + AWS Backup).

### Infrastructure
- HIPAA-compliant hosting
- Geo-redundant storage
- 99.99% API availability SLA
- Automated scaling
- Onboarding: Developer Portal: Interactive API docs (Swagger/Postman), SDKs (Python/JS/Java). FHIR schema guides and sample webhook implementations. Institutional Partnerships: Pre-built connectors for Epic/Cerner EHR systems.

### Compliance
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance
- PHI protection controls
- Automated Audits: GitBlit for real-time commit monitoring against HIPAA rules, and AWS Macie for scanning accidental PHI.
- Geo-Fencing: Spiffe-based workload identity enforces data residency.
- Audit trails for all access
- Data residency options

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core MVP (3 months)
- Basic Git/FHIR data storage
- Read-only API endpoints
- Simple OAuth implementation
- Local development environment

### Phase 2: Institutional Integration (6 months)
- Write API capabilities
- MCP server implementation
- Bulk data operations
- Basic AI query support

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features (9 months+)
- Advanced permissioning
- Government contract support
- Full AI analytics suite
- Global compliance adapters

## Challenges and MCP

- Challenges to Solve: Merge Conflicts: Use CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) or manual review workflows. Data Bloat: Auto-prune old Git branches/commits (with legal approval). Patient Matching: Use MPI (Master Patient Index) algorithms to avoid duplicates.
- MCP Integration Strategy: Bridge Between LLMs and Medical Data: MCP acts as the standardized interface for your AI system to query/update patient data stored in Git repositories. Example: When a doctor asks, “What’s the patient’s latest HbA1c?” via your AI, MCP defines how the LLM retrieves the data from Git/FHIR JSON. Tool Integration: Labs/hospitals use MCP to connect their systems (e.g., EHRs) to your platform, enabling automated data syncing.

## Killer Differentiators
- Git-for-Health CLI: Doctors can use `git diff @~6months` to visualize HbA1c trends, and patients can `git blame` to see which lab added specific results.
- HackerOne for Healthcare: Public bug bounty with HIPAA-safe exploit playground using anonymized FHIR datasets.

## Go-to-Market Strategy
- Landing Pad: Open-Source FHIR-to-Git converter (Apache 2.0) to build developer mindshare.
- HIPAA-in-a-Box SaaS for digital health startups ($999/mo).
- Public Health Contracts: Bid for CDC's Data Modernization Initiative.

## Success Metrics
- 95% FHIR schema validation pass rate
- <500ms API response times
- <1hr institutional onboarding
- 99.99% data availability
- <0.1% PHI exposure risk
