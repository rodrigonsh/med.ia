# MED.ia Use Cases

## Core Healthcare Scenarios

### Data Management & Access
- **Patient Data Versioning:** Track every change to a patient's medical record using Git, providing a complete historical audit trail.
- **Secure Data Access:** Healthcare institutions (hospitals, labs, clinics) securely fetch and update patient data via authenticated APIs.
- **Bulk Data Operations:** Efficiently import and export large datasets (e.g., for city-wide contracts or legacy system migrations).

### AI-Powered Insights
- **Medical Question Answering:** AI system answers complex medical questions by analyzing a patient's historical data (e.g., "What's the patient's HbA1c trend over the last year?").
- **Clinical Decision Support:** AI provides insights and suggestions based on aggregated and anonymized patient data, aiding doctors in diagnosis and treatment.

## Example Workflows (from 00-startup)

### Lab Updates Data
1. Lab authenticates via OAuth (with `lab:write` scope).
2. POSTs new FHIR Observation to `/patients/{id}/records`.
3. System creates a Git commit: `Lab A added HbA1c result on 2023-10-01`.

### Hospital Retrieves History
1. Hospital authenticates via OAuth (with `hospital:read` scope).
2. GET `/patients/{id}/records` returns all Git commits + diffs for a patient's history.

### AI Query
1. User (e.g., doctor) asks: "Did the patientâ€™s cholesterol improve?"
2. AI analyzes commit history for LDL trends, potentially citing specific commit SHAs.

## Advanced Use Cases (Killer Differentiators)

### Git-for-Health CLI
- **Doctor's Trend Analysis:** Doctors run `git diff @~6months` to visualize specific medical trends (e.g., HbA1c) directly in their terminal.
- **Patient Data Transparency:** Patients use `git blame` to see which institution or lab added specific results to their record, enhancing trust and transparency.

### HackerOne for Healthcare
- **Secure Bug Bounty:** A public bug bounty program with a HIPAA-safe exploit playground using anonymized FHIR datasets, encouraging security research without compromising patient privacy.

## Challenges as Use Cases (How the System Solves Them)

### Merge Conflicts
- **Conflict Resolution:** Implement CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) or manual review workflows to manage and resolve conflicting updates to patient records from multiple sources.

### Data Bloat
- **Automated Data Pruning:** Auto-prune old Git branches/commits (with legal and patient approval) to manage storage and ensure data relevance.

### Patient Matching
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Utilize MPI (Master Patient Index) algorithms to accurately match patients and avoid duplicate records across different institutions.

## Administrative Workflows
- HIPAA compliance auditing
- Medical billing automation
- Staff permission management
- Audit trail generation
- Patient consent management via a dashboard
