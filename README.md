# Healthcare Data Platform with Git Versioning

A secure, version-controlled platform for managing patient medical records using Git repositories and FHIR standards.

## Key Features

- **Git-Based Patient Records**: Each patient has their own Git repository with full version history
- **FHIR Compliance**: Data stored in standardized FHIR R4 JSON format with schema validation
- **Secure API Access**: OAuth 2.0 protected RESTful API for healthcare institutions
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Integrated medical question-answering system with PHI protection
- **Compliance Ready**: HIPAA/GDPR compliant with audit logging and access controls

## Technical Architecture

- **Data Storage**: Git repositories per patient with branch-per-institution pattern
- **Large Files**: IPFS with CID pointers for DICOM/PACS imaging
- **API Layer**: RESTful FHIR endpoints with webhook notifications
- **AI Integration**: MCP server for LLM interactions with medical data
- **Security**: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with patient-issued JWTs

## Development Phases

1. **Core MVP** (3 months): Basic Git/FHIR storage with read-only API
2. **Institutional Integration** (6 months): Write API, MCP server, bulk operations
3. **Enterprise Features** (9 months+): Advanced permissions, government contracts
